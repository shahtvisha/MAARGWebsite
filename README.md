# About MAARG
Maarg is an initiative that started with the idea to bring opportunities from privileged students and professionals to underprivileged students at no cost.

In India, 62% of all dropouts occur at the school level with one out of every 8 underprivileged students giving up on their dreams to settle for jobs of domestic help, clerks, and other low-paying avenues. The root problem begins when there is a lack of awareness in terms of self-assessment and exposure to the existing industry options. We aim to bridge the knowledge gap between the underprivileged sector through a program that encourages them to continue their higher education by seeking guidance directly from professionals in the industry.

Maarg is supported by the Resolution Project and it was founded in 2023 with the vision to ensure that every kid in our country exercises their right to self-determination by providing them with awareness of career options that they can opt for and providing them with support to actualize their dreams.
